                            <h2>The challenge for us</h2>
                            <p>A brand&apos;s success is contingent on appropriate branding, which allows the target audience to easily relate to it. Bakul Fresh lacked a cohesive brand identity, as well as information and modern design trends on their website. Bakul team wanted us to design the website while working on the logo. This was so challenging to align the brand identity with the website without a logo. They wanted design should be  timeless, simple, and distinctive that looks fresh and reflects nature.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              Our second task was to design a user-friendly mobile application. the app will be used by people between the ages of 25 - 60, we had to adhere to a number of visual constraints, such as font selection and data point size. We iterate the UI of the subscription plan numerous times when building the app and website after receiving input from the client and users. Finally, we arrived at the ideal solution.

                            <p>When it comes to design a website without any brand identity it becomes very challenging to create visual language of the website. We distributed the work for all the modules i.e, logo, website & user research(for mobile app) among the team. We worked day & night on both website & logo to meet the client’s requirement. Although it was a one page website but we tried different ideas in order to make it aesthetic, fresh & easy to recognize the product offerings.

                            <p>Team Bakul desired a logo that integrated the letters B, natural, fresh & Ok gesture. We began constructing moodboards for our inspiration in order to match the exact requirements for the logo. We looked at about ten choices and decided on the greatest fit for the brand in less than two weeks.

                            <p>We designed a design framework for the website and mobile app interface while working on the logo. We used Ubuntu as our primary typeface and Poppins as our secondary typeface in the design system. Icons with varying colours and strokes for improved accessibility. To build a visual language, we carefully considered the size, spacing, and placement of each component.
