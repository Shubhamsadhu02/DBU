                            <p>Knowledge should be shared with desired learners.<br />
                                So, when it comes to scalability, secured and economically friendly space to share knowledge, then Spayee is the spot. Our challenge was to restructure a platform, already having millions of learners, and establish their brand identity in the community to stand out at a distinctive position in the global course market and we have successfully made it to the end.</p>
