                                <p>It was our first ever project in this domain & we handled everything from branding to product design with ease.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    Rebranding was our prior task which involved renaming and redesigning the brand identity to represent growth, finance, and freedom. We proposed several names, but the client was adamant about the letter 'F,' so the name 'Fredo' was chosen.</p>

                                <p>Many logo concepts were rejected at first, but our collaborative work with Fredo's team led us to the strong attributes of growth, finance, and freedom, as well as the letter 'F.' So we experimented with these parameters and arrived at the best possible result.</p>

                                <p>They showed us a high fidelity wireframe created by one of their team member
                                    & asked us to improve the visual language & the whole user experience of it.
                                    So we started taking inspiration from multiple inspirational websites & similar real apps such as Finshots, inshorts & so on.

                                    <br/>
                                    To improve the whole User experience we created a design language for Fredo in which we improved Icons, ui components, typography, colors etc. The first few drafts of the dummy screens didn’t work well for them, so we showed some more drafts & they finalised the best one.</p>
